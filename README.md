# TI-83-MINESWEEPER
This is the first program that I ever made that I was proud of. I developed this program during my freshman year of high school in 2017 on the school calculator. Unfortunately, it was a rented calculator, so I don't own one anymore. However, before returning it, I recorded some videos of me playing it and scrolling through the program's code. I have transcribed the code here.
